# CFG-final-project
The project is about a bakery web page.
I have created two pages.
In the first page there are two nav-bars the first one from the left navigates the user through the main or home page, while the seconde nav-bar navigates to another pages
In the second page which user can reach by clicking on the first word in the second nav-bar (Order), they will find the menu and a horizontal list.
This list divides the menu into four sections which enables the user to browse the menu easly.
At the end of the page, down, there is an arrow which navigates the user back to the top of the page.
Finaly there is the footer where user can find the social media icons
